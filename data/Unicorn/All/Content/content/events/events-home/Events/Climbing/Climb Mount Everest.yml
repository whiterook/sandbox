      Value: The face of Half Dome in Yosemite National Park rises 5000 feet above the valley floor. Glaciers have cleaved the&nbsp;dome clear in half, leaving an incredible slab of rock that has become the most iconic rock climb in the world. The Adventure Company sponsors this is a grade VI climb and participants must have experience climbing. The tour&nbsp;will be led by our most experienced climbing guide who has extensive experience climbing in Yosemite.
